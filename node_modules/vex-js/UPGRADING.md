## Upgrade guide to vex 3

#### 1. The `css`, `overlayCSS`, `contentCSS`, and `closeCSS` options have been removed

Use CSS classes in your stylesheets and the appropriate `ClassName` options. Depending on how the CSS options were being used, support may be re-added in the future.

#### 2. `vexOpen` and `vexClose` events are no longer emitted

These depended on jQuery's event system, and it would be too much overhead to include a similar system with vex 3. Use the callbacks `afterOpen` and `afterClose`, passed in with the other options.

#### 3. The return value of `vex.open()` is no longer a jQuery element, but a "vex instance" with its own API

For documentation of this API, see [the API docs](/docs/api/3-Advanced.md).

If you depend on jQuery for manipulating your vex instances, you can still wrap the `rootEl` property of the vex instance with jQuery and continue to use your jQuery code:

Old (using a draggable example):
```javascript
/* $el = some jQuery element... */
vex.open({
    afterOpen: function ($vexContent) {
        $vexContent.append($el)
    }
}).draggable()
```

vex 3:
```javascript
/* $el = some jQuery element... */
$(vex.open({
    afterOpen: function () {
        $(this.contentEl).append($el)
    }
}).rootEl).draggable()
```

#### 4. `vex.dialog` has been replaced by its plugin counterpart, [`vex-dialog`](https://github.com/bbatliner/vex-dialog)

While you can still use `vex.combined.js`, inclusion of vex in build systems such as Browserify or Webpack will require some changes.

Previously, using vex and vex.dialog in a build system looked something like the following:

```javascript
var vex = require('vex-js')
vex.dialog = require('vex-js/js/vex.dialog')
```

Now, you should require `vex-dialog` separately, and register it as a plugin with vex:

```javascript
var vex = require('vex-js')
vex.registerPlugin(require('vex-dialog'))
```

#### 5. `vex` and `vex-dialog` are *safe by default*, meaning the `content` and `message` options, respectively, are treated as a regular string, not raw HTML

The options `unsafeContent` and `unsafeMessage` option have been added, which will not escape any HTML. For more details, see [the dialog docs](/docs/api/1-Basic.md) and [the vex docs](/docs/api/3-Advanced.md).
